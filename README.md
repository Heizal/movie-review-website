 # CHILDREN'S MOVIE REVIEW WEBSITE
 This is a responsive [children's and teen movie review website](https://kidshaven.netlify.app/). It's tailored to this specific age group and provides reviews to the movies and series.

 This is a team project I worked on as part of my Visiola Foundation Coding Bootcamp and it came in first place during the final project pitch session
